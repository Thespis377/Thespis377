Hello everyone.  My name is Greg and I'm a network engineer with nearly 20 yrs of experience.  I've been programming since I was 12 yrs old.  Back then it was in BASIC and GWBASIC.
Most of what you will find here will be network automation related, even though you might get some random stuff thrown in.
